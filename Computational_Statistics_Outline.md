## Computational Statistics Outline



### Objective

The objective of this specialization is to introduce Statistical Computing or Computational Statistics to aspiring or new data scientists. The attendees will learn the basics of probability and bayesian inference. This will be followed by a series of lectures on how to perform inference approximately when exact calculations are not not viable. Finally, PyMC3 will be introduced along with its application to some real world scenarios.

Give some examples of MCMC inference so folks get a sense of what can be done including examples from Fintech. Why are we learning MCMC or Bayesian inference
